      "Response: Investors have the right of first offer to participate in future equity offerings. The Company must first offer any new securities to each Major Investor before offering them to others.

If any Major Investor does not fully exercise their right to purchase, other Fully Exercising Investors have the opportunity to purchase the remaining unsubscribed shares.\n",

      "Query: What is the significance of the Securities Act in relation to the purchase and sale of restricted securities?\n",
      "Response: The Securities Act is significant in relation to the purchase and sale of restricted securities because it requires that securities must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities unless an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available. This Act defines the regulations and exemptions that govern the sale and transfer of restricted securities to ensure compliance with U.S. federal and state securities laws.\n",

For the conversion and termination of Convertible Securities at the Initial Closing, the Purchasers holding Convertible Securities agree to automatically convert their securities into shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock without the need for any action on their part. Additionally, they waive any right to a fraction of a Share upon conversion and agree that the Convertible Securities will be terminated and marked as cancelled by the Company following the Initial Closing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query: What determines the number of Transfer Stock shares in a Proposed Key Holder Transfer?\n",

It is specified that no Holder should contribute more than the public offering price of the Registrable Securities they sold, and a party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation cannot seek contribution from a party not involved in such misconduct. Additionally, a Holder's liability is limited to the proceeds received from the offering, except in cases of willful misconduct or fraud.\n"
